I see that from the parsing of the 'isolate' column (column 10) that the column does not correspond to whether that sequence was an uncultured or isolate sample but rather some information from where the isolate was taken or a potential strain name. I have seen in the 'entries_with_real_isolate_info.csv' file that in the excluded_from_refseq column that there is a description available 'derived from metagenome' which should correspond to a non isolate sequence. 

I want to go ahead and Command F the original metadata file and see if there are any other signs that correspond to how I'm going to associate a sample with uncultured and isolate sequences I think that a sequence with 'uncultured' in the title/organism_name. Full strategy will be posted in the Readme within the py_ncbi.
