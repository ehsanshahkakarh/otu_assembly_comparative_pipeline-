----------------------------------------
Total unmapped entries: 32,572
Note: Limited analysis - genus file contains only taxid and reason columns

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPROVEMENT
----------------------------------------
1. VIRAL ENTRIES:
   - Consider creating virus-specific mapping logic
   - Map to higher taxonomic levels (realm, kingdom)
   - Create 'Viruses' as a pseudo-phylum category

2. EUKARYOTIC CLADE ISSUES:
   - Implement clade-to-phylum mapping rules
   - Use higher-level clades as phylum equivalents
   - Create mapping dictionary for common clades

3. ENVIRONMENTAL SAMPLES:
   - Consider excluding from analysis or
   - Create 'Environmental/Uncultured' categories
   - Use parent taxonomic information when available

4. INCERTAE SEDIS (UNCERTAIN PLACEMENT):
   - Use parent taxonomic level for classification
   - Create 'Unclassified [Parent]' categories

5. MISSING RANKS:
   - Implement rank interpolation logic
   - Use taxonkit reformat with --fill-miss-rank option
   - Create placeholder entries for missing ranks
