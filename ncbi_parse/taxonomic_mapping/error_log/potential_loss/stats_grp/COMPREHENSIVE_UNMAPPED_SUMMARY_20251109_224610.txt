Generated: 2025-11-09 22:46:10

📊 ORIGINAL PROBLEM SCOPE:
----------------------------------------
Total unmapped entries across all levels: 70,379
  • Phylum level: 7,708
  • Family level: 30,099
  • Genus level: 32,572

🔍 AFTER FILTERING ANALYSIS:
----------------------------------------
Total INTERESTING cases requiring attention: 33,306
  • Phylum level: 484
  • Family level: 250
  • Genus level: 32,572

📈 FILTERING EFFECTIVENESS:
----------------------------------------
Filtered out: 37,073 entries (52.7%)
Focus on: 33,306 entries (47.3%)

📋 LEVEL-BY-LEVEL BREAKDOWN:
----------------------------------------
PHYLUM LEVEL:
  Original unmapped: 7,708
  Filtered out: 7,224 (93.7%)
  🎯 Focus on: 484 (6.3%)

FAMILY LEVEL:
  Original unmapped: 30,099
  Filtered out: 29,849 (99.2%)
  🎯 Focus on: 250 (0.8%)

GENUS LEVEL:
  Original unmapped: 32,572
  Filtered out: 0 (0.0%)
  🎯 Focus on: 32,572 (100.0%)

🗂️  FILES CREATED:
----------------------------------------
Interesting cases saved to potential_loss/ directory:
  • interesting_unmapped_phylum_*.csv (484 entries)
  • interesting_unmapped_family_*.csv (250 entries)
  • interesting_unmapped_genus_*.csv (32,572 entries)

🎯 KEY INSIGHTS:
----------------------------------------
1. PHYLUM LEVEL: Most unmapped entries were expected issues
   (viruses, unclassified bacteria/archaea/eukaryota)
   Only 6.3% represent real taxonomic mapping problems

2. FAMILY LEVEL: Excellent filtering effectiveness
   Only 0.8% of unmapped entries need attention
   Most issues are viruses, unclassified taxa, incertae sedis

3. GENUS LEVEL: All entries flagged as interesting
   Genus file lacks lineage info for proper filtering
   All 'No genus found' cases need investigation

🚀 NEXT STEPS:
----------------------------------------
1. Focus analysis on files in potential_loss/ directory
2. For phylum: 484 cases mostly SAR/Opisthokonta clades
3. For family: 250 cases mostly missing family ranks
4. For genus: 32,572 cases need lineage reconstruction
5. Consider using taxonkit reformat --fill-miss-rank
6. Implement clade-to-phylum mapping rules
